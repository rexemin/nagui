# Network Algorithms with a GUI

Network optimization algorithms as seen in the course
*Network Analysisâ„¢* at some Computer Science department
in Mexico.

The stuff in `src/app` is a Dash application (in Python 3),
the pretty and modern visualization. On the other hand, the
contents of `src/algo` are the actual implementations of
the algorithms using the **D** language. Don't @ me for
my programming language choices. I'm sick of C++, and so
are you.
